# Data Engineer Coding Exercise

This program is written to compare two texts and return a similarity score between 0 and 1.
0 means completely different and 1 indicates identical.


By running the bash file[Github]https://github.com/mikesh13/Fetch_Rewards/blob/main/run.sh, it will start a web service on localhost to perform the comparison.
